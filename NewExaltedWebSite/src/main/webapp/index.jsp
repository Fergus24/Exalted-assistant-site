            <p>This website is designed to allow a user to create, maintain and manage a fictional character.</p>

            <p>If you are unfamiliar with the Exalted I would highly recommend the tutorial created by Mengtzu which can be found 
            <a href = "https://mengtzu.github.io/exalted/index.html">here</a>. 
            Full credit goes to him for the inspiration behind this site, created with similar purpose and in matching format to help the 
            transition from tutorial to generation feel as close to seamless as I can manage</p>

            <p>This site is a work in progress so bugs are to be expected. Feel free to let me know about them but I can't promise to fix them straight away as part of the purpose 
            of this site is to demonstrate and improve my Java Skills.</p>
